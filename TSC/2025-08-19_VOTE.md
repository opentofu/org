# Asynchronous Vote on Provider Inclusion in the OpenTofu Registry

On August 5th, the TSC was asked to vote asynchonously on a [provider submission](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/issues/2580) to determine if it is allowed by our [registry policy](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/blob/3e718e7fd1a8493659137eabab4dc4e91969de1e/POLICY.md)

Per our [charter](https://github.com/opentofu/org/blob/main/CHARTER.md), voting was left open for two weeks and concluded on August 19th.

With 5 members voting to reject the submission and one member abstaining, the conclusion was reached to reject this provider submission.
