# Topics to discuss

* 1.11 Status
* Terragrunt integration (standing)
* The future of OpenTofu: "Drop-in replacement" and beyond
  * The community currently steers the roadmap of opentofu, but James is concerned that some people expect a 1:1 feature compatability with terraform forever. James would like to discuss finding a set of versions in whcih OpenTofu can say we're a 'drop in replacement' and for the rest we aim to serve the community. 
  * This clear statement of defining versions allows the maintainers to take steps that they may have hesitated on before
  * James proposes that the opentofu TSC agrees to stop aiming for compatability with all terraform features and instead focus on innovation for a larger set of the community as he believes that the 2 projects have 2 different trajectories.
* New OpenTofu Providers:
  * On the back of the above discussion, James is proposing that we implement a new type of provider for opentofu features.
  * This alows us to be more flexible with feature implementation instead of being locked to the Terraform provider ecosystem.
  * OpenTofu will be able to add new features much easier, and OpenTofu users should be able to author/distrubute new providers much easier
  * A new provider for opentofu allows for much more innovation and the introduction of new features the team has been discussing
    * Batch requests
    * Handling unmanaged resources
    * Improved integration with other tooling (middleware)
  * James has opened an RFC for this [here:](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3080)
