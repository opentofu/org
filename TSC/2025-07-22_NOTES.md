# Notes

## Previous Action Items
* James deferrs creating issue for S3 backend docs
* Igor deferrs updates TSC membership list

## 1.11 Planning:
* Same status as last week
* Christian: Any additional work needed before removing the(planning) label?
* Christian: Planned as a smaller release.
* Laurence: Request to add Azure support to State Encryption
* James: Sure, added
* Considing shipping nightlys/alphas as soon as possible
* Christian: Already making good progress on many of the issues in the release
* Yousif: How are we marketing these features?  How do we push our new releases?
* James: Ephemeral is the big ticket item for this release
* James: Resource/module enabled work and similar show that we are improving the quality of life for users in signifcant ways
* James: Maybe we need to add another medium issue to the release
* Christian: Azure key vault fills that slot I think
* Yousif: The key is communicating that with this change OpenTofu is a better tool to write modules for than Terraform
* Christian: We should include that as part of the blogpost
* Christian: Removed (planning)

## CNCF Onboarding:
* James: Things moving slow with communication with CNCF
* James: It's now in progress
* James: Overview: We are migrating from Opentofu Community Slack to CNCF slack
* Igor: We are in CNCF sandbox, what's the plan / what are the options to move to incubating?
* Igor: Not sure of the benefits of different labels
* James: Things are stable for now, reconsider in 6 months?
* Igor: Incubating is "stable and ready".  Sandbox is "new project"
* Igor: OpenTofu is not a new project and is already "in production"
* James: We should talk to the cncf
* Igor: Helps with the messaging of opentofu stability
* Christian: Action item - someone to have a conversation with the CNCF
* James: Takes the action item


## TSC interacting with RFCs
* Christian: Do we want to look at RFCs as part of the TSC meetings?
* James: All TSC members should be spending time commenting on RFCs regardless.
* Yousif: This meeting is good for making decisions
* Yousif: I don't typically look at OpenTofu RFCs unless asked, we need a process for that
* James: Don't need a rigid process, we could just ping TSC members
* Igor: Can we add a github label?
* Christian: Could request reviews from @TSC on github
* Christian: Also ensure `rfc` label is on RFC pulls

## Terragrunt integration (variables in apply)
* Yousif: Terragrunt needed to avoid bumping supported terraform version as OpenTofu did not add ephemeral right away
* Yousif: Specifically for ephemeral variables, terraform allows -var via command line
* Christian: This is actually already an issue with OpenTofu with state encryption and is being worked on as we speak
* Christian: tl;dr it will function the same as terraform, though the error messages may be slightly different due to state encryption

## Terragrunt integration (provider locks)
* Yousif: Additional question on tg provider cache server for legacy tofu/terraform versions (TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR is the replacement for most scenarios)
* Yousif: Terragrunt needs to be able to generate lockfiles without downloading providers
* Christian: We don't have the zip content hashes in the registry and it's not something that's published by provider authors
* Christian: One option is to modify the registry to calculate and store the hashes during ingest, but it's expensive
* James: Can you raise an issue Yousif?
* Igor: Scalr having similar issues with users confused about multi-platform locking
* Yousif: Will take an action item to create this issue

## Terragrunt integration (OCI module fetching)
* Yousif: Terragrunt would like to support fetching oci modules natively
* Christian: Majority of OpenTofu code is in the internal package, which hapers re-use by other tools
* Christian: Long term goal is moving parts of OpenTofu into libraries
* Christian: Short term approach could be renaming `internal` to `unstable`
* Christian: Another option is companies/sponsors that have a strong interest in these libraries could help with the effort of making libraries
* Yousif: same qustion on HCL functions
* Christian: Existing builting functions are stable and could be broken out if desired
* Christian: Provider defined functions is a whole other problem
* James: All of this conversation should be happening on github


## Community:
* Rishav: What's the status of modules and providers being out of date in the registry due to GH Action issues?  Maybe some monitoring?
* Christian: James is working on this today
* James: <gave a quick demo, see video>
* Christian: This is the best we can do for now, functionally this is a bug with parallelism in GH Actions that they don't seem interested in fixing
* Laurence: Thanks for the support with the Azure work!
