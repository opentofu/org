    - Explanation of various status within charter.
    - Unamunous vote to include become committer. 
  
## Discission on changes from alpha releases to nightly releases as often little change between alpha and beta releases. 
    - allows for more focus on features rather than releases.
    - beta release becomes summary of work.
    - nightlies are currently limited to 30 days.
    - no github releases for nighty builds.
    - no objection to move.
