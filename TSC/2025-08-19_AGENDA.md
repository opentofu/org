# Topics to discuss

* Action Items
* Oracle OCI Backend https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1011#issuecomment-3200338286
* How to move forward with clarifying the messaging on our website
* New OpenTofu Providers:
  * On the back of the above discussion, James is proposing that we implement a new type of provider for opentofu features.
  * This allows us to be more flexible with feature implementation instead of being locked to the Terraform provider ecosystem.
  * OpenTofu will be able to add new features much easier, and OpenTofu users should be able to author/distribute new providers much easier
  * A new provider for opentofu allows for much more innovation and the introduction of new features the team has been discussing
    * Batch requests
    * Handling unmanaged resources
    * Improved integration with other tooling (middleware)
  * James has opened an RFC for this [here:](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/3080)
