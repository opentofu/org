# Notes

## Action Items from previous meeting

All action items from the previous meeting were completed:

Action item carried forward:
- **James**: To have conversation with CNCF about incubating status

## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Backend

**Context**: Oracle has requested adding an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) backend for state storage, similar to existing S3, Tencent Cloud, and HTTP backends. This has been a longstanding issue with previous discussions around naming and acceptance.

**Background**:
- Oracle went against contributing guidelines by raising an issue without prior discussion
- Issue was not initially accepted due to ongoing discussions
- Oracle submitted PR without signed DCO initially  
- Last week, Oracle contacted multiple team members via Slack DMs, public channels, emails to entire team, and LinkedIn requesting acceleration

**Meeting with Oracle**:
James had a productive 30-minute meeting with Oracle team where Oracle committed to:
- Support and maintain the backend if accepted
- Take ownership of all issues and maintenance
- Publicly announce migration of all internal and external Oracle customers to OpenTofu
- Move all internal Oracle usage from Terraform to OpenTofu
- Work with OpenTofu on naming and other requirements

**Technical Considerations**:
- Oracle believes calling their APIs directly (vs S3-compatible API) provides better performance
- Avoids requiring external service dependencies
- Technical reasons documented in the issue

**Naming Discussion**:
- Oracle strongly prefers "OCI" name but this conflicts with Open Container Initiative
- Proposed compromise from Igor: Official name "oracle-oci" with "oci" as alias for migration compatibility
- Proposal from James: "container-oci" for Open Container Initiative backend when implemented

**Decision**: 
**UNANIMOUS APPROVAL** - TSC agrees to accept Oracle backend pending:
- Resolution of naming (proposed: Oracle-OCI as official name, OCI as alias)
- Compliance with contributing guidelines 
- Signed DCO
- Proper copyright handling
- Oracle ownership and maintenance commitment

**Next Steps**:
- James to propose naming approach to Oracle
- Oracle to follow contributing guidelines and DCO process
- Legal review of contribution process, especially for future iterations where bugs are reported in both Terraform and OpenTofu

## Website Messaging Clarification

**Context**: Following previous meeting's discussion about clarifying "drop-in replacement" messaging on website.

**Decision**: James will create PR to clarify website messaging based on previous TSC discussions, with review by TSC members.

## New OpenTofu Providers

**Context**: James presented RFC for implementing new type of OpenTofu provider to enable more flexible future feature implementations and allow innovation beyond current provider protocol limitations.

**Igor's Concerns**:
1. **Value Proposition**: Still unclear what concrete end-user value this provides beyond theoretical benefits
2. **Maintenance Burden**: If new provider type enables features like patch requests and enhanced functionality, community will expect major cloud providers (Azure, AWS, etc.) to support these features. OpenTofu team may not have resources to implement or maintain these features across major providers.

**James's Response**:
- Working on collecting comprehensive list of features this would unlock
- Drafting working group document to define goals and concrete benefits
- Planning to demonstrate value by cataloging existing feature requests that could be addressed with new provider protocol
- Will show historical cases where maintainers wanted to implement features but were blocked by current provider protocol limitations

**Status**: Discussion ongoing, James continuing to develop value proposition and working group proposal.

# Action Items
